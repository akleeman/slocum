Wind arrow files can be used as waypoint icons in OpenCPN to indicate true
wind direction at forecast waypoints. Module rtefcst will encode the names for
these icons in the gpx output file it produces.

To use the icons, copy the entire folder into a directory 'UserIcons' that
must be in the same directory as you opencpn.conf file ($HOME/.opencpn
under Debian/Ubuntu).
