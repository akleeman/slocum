Ensemble Forecasts
===========================

What are ensemble forecasts?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ever wonder how much you can trust a forecast? Some forecasts are more trustable (or confident) than others.
For example, we know that you can trust a forecast for six hours from now more than a forecast for six days from now.
Similarly some areas are easier to forecast than others. San Francisco for example is
much more predictable than Chicago. Wouldn't it be nice if a forecast was capable of telling
you how confident it was? Enter ensemble forecasts. Rather than providing a single (deterministic)
forecast, ensemble forecasts produce a set (or ensemble) of lots of forecasts produced by the exact
same physical model which allows us to look at things like how many of the forecasts agree,
what could be the worst case situation etc ... Curious how these forecasts are produced?
The UK Met Office provides a great description.
A few caveats. Even ensemble forecasts aren't perfect. Each of the forecast members comes from
an numerical model and numerical models are never perfect. To truly understand the uncertainty
of a particular forecast you'd need to not only know the internal uncertainty (this is what
ensemble forecasts provide) but also the model uncertainty -- i.e, what is it that the model
is not capable of producing.

Here are some examples (this link contains pictures!)
